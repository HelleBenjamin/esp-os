An operating system that is designed for microcontrollers. Written in C++. Successor of [Esp-cf](https://github.com/Pepe-57/esp-cf). It's recommended to download from [the releases](https://github.com/Pepe-57/esp-os/releases) and use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) as a serial interface.
## Compatibility
- Tested and fully working on ESP8266 and Arduino Uno R4 Wifi (Requires [Arduino-Kernel](https://github.com/Pepe-57/esp-os/releases/tag/v1.0-arduino)).
- Should work on ESP32.
- May need a modded kernel for other microcontrollers.
- Kernel and OS need to be the same version for now.
## Programs
